MapleStory M Python Farmer
==========================
This is a simple MapleStory M farmer done using Python. It simply sends keystrokes/ keypresses to MapleStory M via ADB

To set it up, you will need:
* An Android Emulator (i.e. BlueStacks, NOX)
* This set of scripts (startFarmerSF80.py, msmFarmerCfg.py, keypress.py, requirements.txt)
* Python environment
* MapleStory M account

The skills mapping are:
* skill1
* skill2
* skill3
* skill4
* skill5
* ab
* abs
* up
* down
* left
* right
* toggle
* jump

Warning
=======
Using this can get your MapleStory M account banned.

Configurations
==============
Most of the settings are found in the variable settings of startFarmer*.py.

Can it be used for other games?
===============================
I reckon that this set of scripts can be used for other side scrolling games as well.
